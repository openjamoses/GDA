# GDA
This repository contains the Gaussians Distribution Algorithms implemented from scratch in python, the initial include generating the synthetic dataset using both single class multivariate and mixture of 3 classes multi-class Gaussian distribution which was later trained and tested by comparing the performances using KNN and GDA models.

No Machine Learning Library is used.

To run the script, just export the notebook script to your Jupyter environment and you will find more instructions

## Good luck!
